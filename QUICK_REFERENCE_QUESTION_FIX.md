## The Problem in 30 Seconds

```javascript
// BROKEN: null fails RLS check
await API.submitQuestion(email, text, type, null, attachment);
//                                            ^^^^
// RLS Policy: church_id IN (...)
// null IN (...) = NULL
// NULL = DENY = HTTP 400 ‚ùå
```

## The Solution in 30 Seconds

```javascript
// FIXED: Trinity UUID passes RLS check
const TRINITY_ID = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
await API.submitQuestion(email, text, type, TRINITY_ID, attachment);
//                                            ^^^^^^^^^
// RLS Policy: church_id IN (...)
// Trinity_UUID IN (...) = TRUE
// TRUE = ALLOW = HTTP 201 ‚úÖ
