## 🚀 What's Next (Before Production)

### 1. URL Routing Setup (REQUIRED)
Currently using query parameters: `?church=trinity`
Need to implement subdirectory routing: `/trinity/parent-portal.html`

**Options:**
- A) Use Vercel's rewrites/redirects (easiest for Vercel)
- B) Set up Express.js backend to handle routing
- C) Use Next.js with built-in routing (best long-term)

**Recommendation:** Use Vercel's `vercel.json` configuration for rewrites

---

### 2. Admin Role Enforcement (IMPORTANT)
Currently:
- Admin functions are accessible to all authenticated users
- We need to verify user.role = 'admin' before allowing admin operations

**What to do:**
1. Add admin checks in `auth.js` - `requireAdmin()` function
2. Protect admin pages (questions-dashboard.html, content-management.html, admin-portal.html)
3. Add role checks in API functions (application-level validation)

**How to set admin:**
For now, manually set `role = 'admin'` in Supabase users table

---

### 3. Email Notifications (NICE-TO-HAVE)
Currently: Questions are saved but admins don't get notified
Implement:
- Email to admin when question is submitted
- Email to user when question is responded to
- Use SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES

---

### 4. Photo Upload Support (OPTIONAL)
Currently: Trip memory form has photo upload UI but doesn't work
Implement:
- Set up Supabase Storage buckets
- Connect upload form to storage
- Display photos in memory gallery

---

### 5. Church Signup/Onboarding (FOR MULTI-CHURCH)
Currently: Only Trinity Church exists
To add new churches:
1. Create landing page for church signup
2. Build onboarding flow to create new church
3. Auto-populate sample events/resources for new church
4. Set church admin during signup

---

### 6. Deploy to Vercel (REQUIRED FOR TESTING)
When ready to share with your brother:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
3. Set environment variables (Supabase URL, API key)
4. Deploy

**Current issue:** Files are in root directory, need proper structure for Vercel

2. **Test all features** thoroughly with Trinity Church setup

### BEFORE SHOWING YOUR BROTHER:
1. **Deploy to Vercel** - So he can access via URL
2. **Fix URL routing** - Use proper subdirectory format if possible
3. **Create admin user** - Set your email as admin in database
4. **Write user guide** - Quick guide for your brother on how to use

### LATER (WHEN READY FOR MULTI-CHURCH):
1. Build church signup flow
2. Implement email notifications
3. Add photo upload support

## 📌 Important Notes

- **Data is isolated by church_id at database level** - Even if a user somehow bypasses the frontend, RLS policies prevent access to other churches' data
- **All API calls include churchId parameter** - Double-layer security with application-level filtering + database-level RLS
- **Church context persists in localStorage** - Users stay on the same church across page navigation
- **Query parameter routing** - Works now, future-proof for subdirectory routing

---

- Isolates data between churches
- Provides complete admin panel
- Handles payments, documents, memories, events, FAQs
