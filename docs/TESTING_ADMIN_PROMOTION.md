# Testing the Admin Promotion Feature

## Quick Start Test (5 minutes)

Follow these steps to test the new admin promotion feature end-to-end.

---

## Prerequisites

You'll need:
1. The app running locally: `http://localhost:8000`
2. A super admin account (role = 'admin')
3. A test user account to promote (role = 'parent')
4. Trinity Church set up in database (UUID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`)

---

## Step 1: Access the Super Admin Portal

1. Open browser to: `http://localhost:8000/super-admin-portal.html?church=trinity`
2. Log in with your super admin account
3. You should see:
   - "Super Admin Dashboard" header
   - "Add New Church" form
   - "Manage Churches" section with churches table
   - **NEW:** "Manage Church Users" section at the bottom

---

## Step 2: Create a Test User (if needed)

If you don't have a test user to promote, create one first:

1. Go to: `http://localhost:8000/login.html?church=trinity`
2. Click "Sign Up" tab
3. Fill in:
   - Name: "Test User"
   - Email: "testuser@example.com"
   - Password: "TestPassword123"
4. Click "Sign Up"
5. You should be auto-signed in as parent

Now create another test user (different email) to have someone to promote.

---

## Step 3: View Church Users

Back in the Super Admin Portal:

1. Scroll to "Manage Church Users" section
2. Click dropdown labeled "Select Church to View Users"
3. Select "Trinity Church" (or whatever church name you have)
4. A table should appear with users for Trinity

**Table should show:**
| Email | Name | Role | Joined | Actions |
|-------|------|------|--------|---------|
| your@email.com | Your Name | Parent | [today's date] | Promote to Admin |
| testuser@example.com | Test User | Parent | [today's date] | Promote to Admin |

---

## Step 4: Test Promotion

1. Find the test user in the table
2. Click the **"Promote to Admin"** button
3. Confirm dialog appears: "Promote this user to admin? They will be able to manage church content, events, and responses."
4. Click **"OK"** to confirm
5. Success alert appears: "User promoted to admin successfully!"
6. Table refreshes automatically
7. Test user's role changes to **"Admin"** (blue badge)
8. Button changes to **"Demote to Parent"**

‚úÖ **Promotion successful!**

---

## Step 5: Verify Admin Can Access Admin Portal

Now verify the promoted user can actually access the admin portal:

1. Log out of super admin portal
2. Log in as the test user (testuser@example.com / TestPassword123)
3. You should be redirected to parent portal
4. In URL bar, manually navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/admin-portal.html?church=trinity`
5. Page should load (no permission error)
6. You should see admin dashboard with tabs for Students, Payments, Documents, etc.

‚úÖ **Admin access works!**

---

## Step 6: Test Demotion

1. Log back in as super admin
2. Go to super-admin-portal.html
3. Go to "Manage Church Users" section
4. Select Trinity Church again
5. Find the user you just promoted (now showing as "Admin")
6. Click **"Demote to Parent"** button
7. Confirm dialog appears: "Demote this user from admin? They will lose admin privileges."
8. Click **"OK"** to confirm
9. Success alert appears: "User demoted from admin successfully!"
10. Table refreshes
11. User role changes back to **"Parent"**

‚úÖ **Demotion successful!**

---

## Step 7: Verify Demoted User Can't Access Admin

1. Log out of super admin
2. Log in as the demoted test user
3. In URL bar, try to navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/admin-portal.html?church=trinity`
4. You should be redirected to: `http://localhost:8000/login.html` with permission error
5. Or if logged in, you should see: "You do not have permission to access this page"

‚úÖ **Permission check works!**

---

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Church Onboarding

**Simulate the church onboarding workflow:**

1. Create a new church via "Add New Church" form:
   - Name: "Test Church"
   - Slug: "testchurch"
   - Trip Name: "Test Trip 2026"

2. Invite a test user to sign up at: `http://localhost:8000/login.html?church=testchurch`

3. Have them sign up as a new account

4. Go back to super admin portal

5. Use "Manage Church Users" to promote them to admin

6. Verify they can access the admin portal at: `http://localhost:8000/admin-portal.html?church=testchurch`

‚úÖ **New church workflow complete!**

### Scenario 2: Emergency Admin Cover

**Test quick admin assignment:**

1. Create a quick test user (don't need them to sign up, can create directly)

2. Use promotion feature to make them admin instantly (< 30 seconds)

3. Verify they have access

4. Demote them when done

‚úÖ **Emergency coverage works!**

### Scenario 3: Staff Rotation

**Test removing admin privileges:**

1. Have an admin user (use one from scenario 1 or 2)

2. Use demotion feature to remove admin role

3. Verify they can no longer access admin portal

4. Verify they still have parent access (can log in to parent portal)

‚úÖ **Staff rotation works!**

## Troubleshooting During Testing

### Issue: "Manage Church Users" section doesn't appear

**Fix:**
- Make sure you're logged in as a super admin (role = 'admin')
- Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Issue: Church dropdown is empty

**Fix:**
- Make sure you've created at least one church (Trinity should exist)
- Check that the churches are in your database
- Reload the page and try again

### Issue: Table shows "No users found for this church"

**Fix:**
- Make sure at least one user has signed up for that church
- Create a test user by signing up at the login page with that church's slug
- Check the database directly to verify users exist

### Issue: "You do not have permission to promote users" error

**Fix:**
- Make sure you're logged in as a super admin (role = 'admin')
- The user you're logged in as must be the "admin" role (not "parent")
- Try logging out and back in

### Issue: User still can't access admin portal after promotion

**Fix:**
- Have them do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows, Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- Have them log out and log back in
- Their auth token may be cached with old role

## Success Criteria

The feature is working correctly if all these pass:

‚úÖ Super admin can view "Manage Church Users" section
‚úÖ Can select a church and see its users
‚úÖ Can click "Promote to Admin" button
‚úÖ Confirmation dialog appears before promotion
‚úÖ User role changes to Admin in table
‚úÖ Promoted user can access admin portal
‚úÖ Admin user shows "Demote to Parent" button instead
‚úÖ Can click "Demote to Parent" button
‚úÖ Confirmation dialog appears before demotion
‚úÖ User role changes back to Parent in table
‚úÖ Demoted user cannot access admin portal (redirected to login)
‚úÖ Success/error alerts appear appropriately
‚úÖ All operations complete in < 5 seconds

---

## Browser Console Checks

If something isn't working, check the browser console for errors:

1. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
2. Click the **"Console"** tab
3. Look for any red error messages
4. Note the error and check what operation triggered it

Common errors to look for:
- `API.getChurchUsers is not a function` - api.js not loaded
- `Cannot read property 'value' of null` - HTML element missing
- `403 Forbidden` - Permission issue in database
- `Network error` - Database connection issue

---

## Performance Expectations

When everything is working correctly:

- **Load users**: < 1 second
- **Promote user**: < 2 seconds
- **Demote user**: < 2 seconds
- **Table refresh**: < 1 second

If operations take much longer (> 5 seconds), there may be a network or database issue.

---

## Database Verification

If you want to verify changes directly in the database:

1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. SQL Editor
3. Run this query:

```sql
SELECT id, email, full_name, role, church_id
FROM users
WHERE church_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
ORDER BY email;
```

You should see:
- Your users for Trinity Church
- Role column showing 'admin' or 'parent'
- Changes reflected after each promotion/demotion

---

## Next Steps After Testing

Once testing passes:

1. ‚úÖ Feature is ready for production
2. üìö Share ADMIN_PROMOTION_GUIDE.md with church admins
3. üöÄ Deploy to Vercel
4. üìä Monitor for any issues
5. üìù Update any other documentation that references admin promotion

---

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug during testing:

1. Note the exact steps to reproduce
2. Take a screenshot or console error
3. Check the browser console (F12) for error messages
4. Document which operation failed and what the error was

Common issues and fixes:
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check database connection in Supabase dashboard
- Verify user has correct role in database
- Ensure API functions are loaded in api.js

---

## Summary
