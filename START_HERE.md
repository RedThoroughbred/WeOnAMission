# START HERE üëà

Welcome! You're reading this because we just completed a comprehensive planning session for your React migration.

## What Just Happened

1. ‚úÖ **Reverted to working vanilla JS** - Your homepage works perfectly again
2. ‚úÖ **Identified the real problem** - RLS policies, not bad React code
3. ‚úÖ **Created a solid migration plan** - 6 weeks, zero risk, incremental

## Where Things Stand

**Right now, today:**
- ‚úÖ Homepage works (vanilla JS at `http://localhost:3000/index.html?church=trinity`)
- ‚úÖ All data loads (events, resources, FAQs, memories)
- ‚úÖ All features work (navigation, dark mode, countdown timer)
- ‚úÖ You have a clear plan for React migration

### Immediately (Today)
1. Read **REACT_MIGRATION_INDEX.md** (5 minutes)
2. Read **SESSION_SUMMARY.md** (5 minutes)
3. Read **MIGRATION_QUICK_START.md** (10 minutes)

Total time: 20 minutes

### Soon (This Week)
1. Read **MIGRATION_PLAN_REACT.md** (15 minutes)
2. Decide if you want to proceed with Phase 1
3. Block 3-4 hours on your calendar for Phase 1

### Phase 1 (When Ready)
1. Follow **PHASE1_AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md**
2. Audit api.js (every function)
3. Audit RLS policies (every table)
4. Trace data flows
5. Create AUDIT_FINDINGS.md

## Right Now

**Your system is working perfectly.** The vanilla version will continue to work during the entire migration. You have zero risk of breaking anything.

**Test it now**: http://localhost:3000/index.html?church=trinity

You should see:
- ‚úÖ 7 events with times and locations
- ‚úÖ 6 resources with links
- ‚úÖ 6 FAQs with expandable answers
- ‚úÖ "View Memory Book" button
- ‚úÖ Hamburger menu with navigation
- ‚úÖ Dark mode toggle
- ‚úÖ Countdown timer

If all of that works, your system is good.

## The Plan (In 60 Seconds)

```
Week 1: Understand the system (Phase 1 audit)
Week 2: Fix RLS policies (Phase 2)
Week 3: Build data layer (Phase 3)
Week 4: Create React components (Phase 4)
Week 5: Migrate homepage to React (Phase 5)
Week 6+: Migrate other pages (Phase 6+)
```

**Key rule**: Vanilla JS version never breaks. Always works as fallback. Zero risk.

## Why This Works

- **Incremental**: One page at a time
- **Testable**: Side-by-side comparison
- **Reusable**: Same data layer for vanilla AND React
- **Reversible**: Easy to roll back any page
- **Documented**: Clear at every step
